# React with NextJS Assignment

## Assignment Description

This assignment involves creating a simple site using NextJS, a full-stack framework that utilizes ReactJS for the front end. Instead of the MERN stack, we’ll focus on this integrated stack. 

### Requirements:
1. **Server Setup:**  
   - Host your site on the course server running on Node.js.
   - Use your assigned port in the format `30XX` (e.g., userXX, dbXX).
   - Utilize `tmux` to ensure the app remains responsive after disconnection.
   
2. **GitHub Link:**  
   - Include a link on the page to your public GitHub repository containing the project code.
   
3. **Submission:**  
   - Submit the link to your hosted app.
